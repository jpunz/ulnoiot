DoorLock and Thermostat are 2 MQTT-controlled Java-Desktop-Applications.

Before running each of the Applications, you have to enter your MQTT-Broker-IP into the MQTT-Client-Constructor.

DoorLock currently only accepts the NFC-Payload "198,174,119,65", just adapt this to your desired NFC-Chip's payload.
